# Vocabulary Builder
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a platform to enhance online language learning experience.  
Lately remote language lessons have become increasingly popular. It is common that teachers have to compose vocabulary sets for each and every lesson. On the other side students have no obvious way to practise this vocabulary rather than on the lesson itself.
I thought it would be convenient if teachers had a way to control the pull of words for every student and students had a way to practise them by solving quizes generated by various criteria (lesson number, part of speech, theme ect.)

__current functionality__: basic user login, quiz generation and real-time check
